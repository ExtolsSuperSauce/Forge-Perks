How to install: Extract into this file location, and make sure it's structured like so: "Steam/steamapps/common/Noita/mods/Forge_Perks/mod.xml"

DESCRIPTION

HUGE thanks to BurningLily for help with the sprites! Special thanks to Coxas, Horscht, and Ryyst! Huge mod with 3 Classes that do very different things. Figure out their uses, and exploit their power!

Adds a new structures to the Right of Hiisi Base that contains perks, and puts an E to Interact onto the Forge to do fancy things. Also a chance for a Potion Seller in HMs! (Also seconds as an ok DPS dummy)

Description of perks:

Machinery: "Smelt Wands from Metal" Pressing E on the Forge with a "Material Counter" will make a wand appear.

Mastery: "Upgrade Wands from Mysterious Liquids" Pressing E on the Forge with a "Material Counter", and a Wand in hand makes it stronger.

Note: Material Counters can be gained from either sources of Metal or Wand Blood no matter the perk you chose.

Alchemistery: "Destroy Wands for Spells" Pressing E on the Forge with a Wand in had breaks it, dropping all spells, a wand part, and a few extra spells for your trouble. Also! Pressing E while holding a wand part to put it into the forge. 3 will make an animated wand!

Book next to the Forge hinting at helpful Alchemy. Each perk also drops a book explaining more. Mastery Perk has lots of useful alchemy info!

No more bugs! Should work with other biome mods, and even works after restarts! Have Fun!!!!
